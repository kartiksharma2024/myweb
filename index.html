Hello, i'am kartik sharma and i'am a student of Arena Animation. As a UI/UX & Graphic Designer, i've enjoyed tirning complex problems itno simple, beautiful designs. when i'm not pushing pixels, you'll find me doing makeup's, cooking. and also i have over 4 years of experience in the world of makeup and beauty and i'am passionate about making each and every client feel fabulus in theur own skin. my true passion is makeup but over the years i have added numerous beauty treatments to my skill set whicch i feel further enhnces my offering to all my clients.  The best part is that freelance makeup artists can pick and choose the type of clients, projects, and hours that suit them. They do fashion shows, photo shoots, personal makeup, corporate events, etc. The outlets in this route need to do an excellent job at selling themselves to get new clients and worker talent, so they have to market themselves well to build a loyal customer base and keep a consistent pipeline of work going.
